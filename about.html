            The Boondocks Gang unit is composed of Bobby aka Ex-Ray,
            Frank aka Odi wa Murang’a and Edward aka Maddox, three ambitious rappers
            whose club-bangers such as Mathogothanio, Mboko Haram and Rieng Remix have
            become the craze among Pulsers.
            “Rieng Remix was the main project that propelled us into the limelight, and we give a
            major shout-out to Kristoff, Vdj Jones and Rankadda for the opportunity,” says Ex-Ray.
            “But our journey actually started during a drama project when I met with Maddox and
            later we joined hands with Odi wa Murang’a since our chemistry was in-sync, and from
            then we started singing. Back then we were doing gospel music but later we realised that
            we were well-versed with the Gengetone sound and message. That is when we jumped ship.
            The gospel music industry was full of hypocrisy and couldn’t work since we wanted to be
            real and reflect it in our music and that’s how we settled on Gengetone,” Ex-Ray explains.
            “We officially formed the group last year and since we were all doing different genres
            we decided to bring them together and make a new wave. We do street music, which
            nowadays actually sells and people are supportive. But in as much as we try to school
            these whack-jobs we still appreciate the old artistes but again, honestly speaking,
            their time is up,” adds Maddox.

           The young stars, who seemingly sent the old stars into early retirement by taking
        over
        the streets and the ghetto fans - the highest consumers of Gengetone music, are currently
        working on new tracks under the label.
        They are all 'balling' in a small space but with time they will prove their mettle and rule
        the nest. They say they have no bad blood with anyone in the industry and they would very
        much appreciate working with Khaligraph Jones, Sauti Sol and Nyashinski.
